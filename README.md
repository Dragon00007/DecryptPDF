# Decrypt/Unlock pdf files
This script can remove encryption or password(provided that you know the password) from your PDF documents to make them editable\commentable\markable. This script runs completely offline on your local Machine, so you don't have to upload your documents to third party websites.
In case of open password protected PDF files press Enter when prompted.

Even low powered machines can unlock PDF files in a matter of seconds!


# Pre-built version
Download and extract the zip file and it's ready to run. https://github.com/Dragon00007/DecryptPDF/releases/tag/v0.11

Also, about the file size, I couldn't make it smaller because python is not installed by default on all PCs. This package contains the entire python library and other dependencies so that it can function on any PC. That's why the program is big. But I think 65MB isn't a very big file size.

*Antivirus softwares might warn you about this program since it's not signed. You don't have to worry though because it is just a false positive. This program is completely safe to use. 

# Downsides
If you want to run this script raw on your machine, you need to have python 3.9 installed + the required modules.
Required modules: pikepdf
